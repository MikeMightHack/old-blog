# Hi!
I am currently a Pentester at Cyberproof, where I usually do web pentesting stuff but also somtetimes I have the opportunity to participate in other types of exercises like Phishing, pentesting of infrastructures and so on. In addition, I usually develop tools that help automate tasks related to vulnerability detection, mainly with python.

During my free time, I like to spend my time on hacking platforms, such as Hack The Box, learning new techniques and exploiting vulnerabilities I did not know about. But it is not all work, I love travelling and seeing new places, spending time with my friends and playing any kind of sport, in short, getting out of my chair and spending time out of my room.
