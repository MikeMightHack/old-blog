We start with a basic nmap. We see that we have port 22 (ssh) and 80 (http) open.
![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\HTB\RouterSpace\20220309160318.png){: .align-center}


On port 80, we find the following web application:
![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\HTB\RouterSpace\20220309160409.png){: .align-center}


The download button will download an apk file.

If we install this program in an emulator, in our case anbox, we can see the following application:

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\HTB\RouterSpace\20220309160633.png){: .align-center}


To see if the application makes any http requests, we can set burp as a proxy and intercept the requests.

To do this, we can configure the burp as follows:
![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\HTB\RouterSpace\20220309160837.png){: .align-center}

  
In the address field, we use the IP of our HTB vpn, in my case the tun0 interface IP address. Using adb, we configure the anbox emulator proxy:

```sh
adb shell settings put global http_proxy <IP>:8080
```

Once configured, we will see the following request made by the application:

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\HTB\RouterSpace\20220309161100.png){: .align-center}

We send this request to the repeater.
If we try to launch it again, it will give us the following error:

**Unknown host: routerspace.htb**

To fix this, we add **routerspace.htb** to **/etc/host**. Once added, the request will work for us.

If we modify the IP parameter, to try to inject a command, we see in the response that it is simply reflected:

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\HTB\RouterSpace\20220309161318.png){: .align-center}

But if we try to bypass the filter with the following characters, for example: ``;, |, \n,`` we see in the response the result of the command.

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\HTB\RouterSpace\20220309161526.png){: .align-center}

If we try to send ourselves a reverse shell, it will not reach us. Surely there is some rule in the firewall.
  
But we remember that we had an ssh service running on the victim machine.
Check if the /home/paul/.ssh/authorized_keys file exists:

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\HTB\RouterSpace\20220309161751.png){: .align-center}

We can generate an rsa key for ssh and write the public key to the authorized_keys file to gain access to the server via ssh.

To generate the keys:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

To upload the public key:

```sh
; echo 'public key'
```

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\HTB\RouterSpace\20220309162249.png){: .align-center}

Once uploaded, we can connect with the following command: 

```sh
ssh -i id_rsa paul@10.10.11.148
```

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\HTB\RouterSpace\20220309163123.png){: .align-center}

In paul's home, we have the user.txt.

## Privilege Escalation

To escalate privileges, we will use [LinPEAS.sh](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS).

To transfer the file to the victim machine, we can do it through scp:

```sh
scp -i id_rsa ~/tools/PrivEsc/linux/linpeas.sh paul@10.10.11.148:.
```

Execute:

```sh
./linpeas.sh
```

In the output of the tool, ee see that it is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3156 (Sudo Baron Samedit) as is is shown in the image below:

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\HTB\RouterSpace\20220309163418.png){: .align-center}

To exploit the vulnerability we will use the following exploit: 
- [Exploit (Worawit)](https://github.com/worawit/CVE-2021-3156/blob/main/exploit_nss.py)

Transfer the exploit using scp and execute it:

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\HTB\RouterSpace\20220309163613.png){: .align-center}

And finally, we are root! ðŸ”¥
